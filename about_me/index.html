       About Me

      <p>
        <h1>Intro</h1>
        Hey all! Thanks for taking the time to visit my website. My name is Chris Miklius and I come from a tightly knit family of 6 kids (I'm the 5th in line to give some perspective). I am a 22 year old Mathmatician from the Chicago suburbs (Northwest if you're in the area) and I am ready to find a career in development!
      </p>

      <p>
        <h1>Why DBC?</h1>
          So I recently graduated from Seton Hall University (Go Pirates!) with a BS in Mathematics. The degree was a great way to improve my way of thinking as well as my discipline with reagards to hard work. I really enjoyed the curriculum that Math had to offer, but I wasn't sure of where I wanted to go with it, or even where I wanted to go with my education or emlployment in general. It was then that my classmate told me about DBC. We were doing homework one night and he explained the whole philosophy and the amazing prospects the program had to offer. I was sold on applying from that point on, and after graduation that's exactly what I did. After many assignments and two rounds of interviews, here I am in the midst of what I would consider the beginning of my journey towards something amazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
        Well the thing with programming is that it was really something that I always wanted to jump into, but I never felt that the time was right until now. The concept of having a tangible result of your efforts is a concept I always liked, which I suppose explains a great deal of my admiration for the field. There were times I attempted courses in the past, but the scope and instruction were so limited that nothing ever really clicked. Fast forward to DBC, which prides itself on teaching a wide variety of languages instead of telling you which is best. The teaching philosophy here is much more to my liking with it being a much involved and cohesive process.

      <p><h1>What are your interests?</h1>

        I have three great passions in this world: music, swimming, and video games. If anyone asked me to describe my interests in three words, those would be it. My musical taste was something I inherited in part from my older siblings, though eventually I found my own unique tastes. My favorites include The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Weezer, Incubus, Company of Thieves, and plenty more. As for swimming, I was a competetive swimmer for the better part of my life, and honestly it was something I grew to really enjoy. The competetive scene gives such a rush, and an individualized sport like swimming really fit the bill for me. I also love watching team USA swim at the summer olympics, with my favorites being Michael Phelps and Missy Franklin. Video Games are really the thing that defines myself as well as most of the people I know. It's a great way to wind down, and I also feel that they are a very great form of media that warrant participation from the audience as opposed to being a simple observer. You get to be part of the experience with a video game, which is more than you can say for most other things.

      </p>

      <p><h1>Something Quirky</h1>
        Something quirky about me is that I collect statues of my favorite fictional characters. This mostly ends up being video game characters (special shoutouts go out to Nintendo). I just really like how they look on my shelf. It's a bit of a sickness I will admit. Also did I mention that I enjoy videogames? I really do. Let me know if you play as well. I'd love to play with some new people.
      </p>

      <p><h1>Gaming Handles</h1>
        Since I mentioned gaming, I should probably mention my accounts as well. Feel free to contact me and we can get some fun gaming sessions going (Try my facebook or twitter as far as contacting me. They are on the bottom of the home page in case you forgot :D).</p>
