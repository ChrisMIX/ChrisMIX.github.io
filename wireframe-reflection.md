**What is a wireframe?**
A wireframe is a schematic for website building, and gives you a basic idea of the design you want. It's essentially an outline for an HTML coding project.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**
The benefit is that after doing it you have an idea of where you want to go with your coding. The other thing to consider is that it helps you to stay focused on the task at hand. With the finish line in mind, it's easier to stay on task.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
I enjoyed the wireframing process, because it let me build my ideal website first without any code. It lets me get creative without the fear of wasting any time or effort.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
I stuck with my gut instinct on what I wanted. Perhaps down the line I may come to edit my ideas a bit more in the planning process.

**What questions did you ask during the challenge? What resources did you find to help your answer?**
I did not need any assistance with the wireframing tools, but I looked into the github forums for information on relative paths for markdown style of inline imaging.

**What parts of the challenge did you enjoy and what parts did you find tedious?**
I enjoyed being creative with the wireframing and letting my ideas flow out. Nothing was terribly tedious in this challenge.
