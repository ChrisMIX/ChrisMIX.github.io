**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**
I learned about spacing out text to the point where it isn't all jumbled together, which was certainly a plus. The website looks fuller and more professional just by playing around with margins and smaller details.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
I figured out how to properly format text so it aligns the way I want it to. The alignments have more purpose, as opposed to just being like that by default.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
The easiest parts to implement were changing the text settings and background color. Formatting the alignment of the text and adding images took a little bit longer.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
Adding and formatting elements in CSS is like putting the finer details into your site. You focus less on the big picture and more on the personal preferences and smaller details.
