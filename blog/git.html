      Version control is a great resource that allows you to monitor every version of a project at each stage of the creation process. If something goes wrong down the line, you are able to revert to a previous version and try again, versus taking a longer amount of time struggling to address the issues.

        Git helps to keep track of changes through the use of branches. You create your own iterations of the main file and add various changes until you are satisfied with the fully funcional results. Git lets you know when the master file is out of date compared to the various branches and it allows you to merge them into one branch once changes area finalized.

        Github is a great place to store code because anyone can access it. Github stores your files and branches in an online resource, similar to that of Dropbox. At this point anyone you choose can access it and provide their own changes, which are also monitored and noted in branches from the main file. Ultimately, github is convenient in facilitating partner projects and promoting collaboration without the fear of someone ruining the main file you are working on.
