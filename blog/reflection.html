            <p>
                Up to this point in time, building a website has been an amazing experience. I have learned so many incredible things I never thought I could know how to do. I like the empowerment that comes with this whole process. I feel like I can approach more difficult and adventerous tasks as a coder. It's a great feeling overall. The thing that can be a bit taxing about this process is not having an immediate answer for a change I may want to make. Of course that's where research and trial and error come in, but it still can be a bit disheartening. That's the thing about developing is that it takes time. There is a lot of experimentation, and it is a big time commitment. I feel I have a better understanding of that now. Having been immersed into development these past nine weeks has been really eye opening.
