How was it to create an HTML page with a pair?

Creating the page with my pair was interesting, and definitelya new experience. It was nice to have someone to bonce ideas off of in the creative process. The idea of having someone there to tell you if you may be getting off track or pointing out syntax related information is quite valuable. Having a second opinion keeps you grounded, as well as focused.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I thought wireframing was helpful, knowing what my end result should look like. Coding with an end destination in mind really prevents my ideas from getting the better of me. If I know what I want already, I won't be wasting as much time deliberating over stylistic choices. To me, wireframing is to html as an outline is to an essay. You can totally get the job done without it, but the process is streamlined to a great extent.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided a more general approach is better. Honestly wireframing is meant to give you a skeleton for you to refer to in the future. You don't want to get too specific with your wireframe to the point where it has limited use. The more assignments your wireframe can assist you with, the better.

What new semantic elements did you learn about, (if any)?

I learned about wireframing formatting in general. I also got a nice refresher on basic html formatting, which is always good.
