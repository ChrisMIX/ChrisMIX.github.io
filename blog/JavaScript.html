            <h1>Have a Nice Cup of JavaScript</h1>
            <h4>11/9/15</h4>
            <p>
                Welcome back! Today I am here to tell you all about Looping in Ruby and Javascript. At their core, they both accomplish the same tasks. The syntax can differ a bit between the two languages however. Let's consider an example. Imagine we want to write a program that prints phrase "Cool story bro." ten times. We will start by using the while loop for both programs. Check out the following codeblock...
            </p>

            <p class = "codeblock">
                #Ruby first
                <br>
                counter = 1
                <br>
                while counter <= 10
                <br>
                puts "Cool story bro."
                <br>
                counter += 1
                <br>
                end
                <br>
                <br>
                //Javascript Next
                <br>
                var counter = 1
                var statement = "Cool story bro."
                <br>
                while (counter <= 10){
                <br>
                console.log("Cool story bro.")
                <br>
                counter++
                <br>
                }
            </p>

            <p> Now both of these will do the same exact things, but they have different ways of doing it. With Javascript, we first establish our counter. Then we establish our condition that will keep printing the statement we want. We increment our counter and then keep going until the counter hits 11. Ultimately what I described is true for Ruby as well, but the syntax is slightly different. For loops work similarly in both Ruby and Javascript as well. Take a look...
            </p>

            <p class = "codeblock">
                #Ruby
                <br>
                for num in 1..10
                <br>
                puts "Cool story bro."
                <br>
                end
                <br>
                <br>
                //Javascript
                <br>
                for (var counter = 0; counter <= 10; counter++)
                <br>
                console.log("Cool story bro.");
            </p>

            <p> Now both of these loops are very shortened versions of the while loops we saw a moment ago. That's why the for loop is used. Javascript manages to take the already short for loop from Ruby and take one line away on top of it. Javascript's for loop has three different parameters in parentheses telling the loop what to do. The first defines your counter. The second tells the loop when to stop and the third increments the counter. Aside from that, we just use a print statement. Now you see how the looping process of Javascript and Ruby really isn't that different. Well that's it for now. Tune in again next week!

How was it to create an HTML page with a pair?

Creating the page with my pair was interesting, and definitelya new experience. It was nice to have someone to bonce ideas off of in the creative process. The idea of having someone there to tell you if you may be getting off track or pointing out syntax related information is quite valuable. Having a second opinion keeps you grounded, as well as focused.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I thought wireframing was helpful, knowing what my end result should look like. Coding with an end destination in mind really prevents my ideas from getting the better of me. If I know what I want already, I won't be wasting as much time deliberating over stylistic choices. To me, wireframing is to html as an outline is to an essay. You can totally get the job done without it, but the process is streamlined to a great extent.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided a more general approach is better. Honestly wireframing is meant to give you a skeleton for you to refer to in the future. You don't want to get too specific with your wireframe to the point where it has limited use. The more assignments your wireframe can assist you with, the better.

What new semantic elements did you learn about, (if any)?

I learned about wireframing formatting in general. I also got a nice refresher on basic html formatting, which is always good.
