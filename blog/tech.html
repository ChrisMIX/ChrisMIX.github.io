            <h1>We're going off the Rails on this Ruby train...</h1>
            <p>
                Hello again. Today I'm here to tell you all about Rails. What is Rails you may ask? Rails is an extension of the Ruby language we already know and love. It is also known as Ruby on Rails, just in case you weren't aware already. You install it using the command line on your computer, and it allows you to build websites using the Ruby language. Rails takes website building and streamlines the process. It combines Ruby with the likes of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. and runs on a web server. For this reason, Rails is considered a "back-end" web development platform (a browser would be considered the "front-end"). Now why would you want to use Rails? Allow me to explain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rails is a website building tool that is built on a Ruby framework. What is great about this is that it comes with the benefits of Ruby. Also, buliding a web app in Rails is significantly quicker than it would be in a java framework. The other thing worth noting is that Rails is full stack, meaning that every piece of the web app works together seamlessly and it takes less code than with other altervatives. It also means that you have everything you need to build a database driven web app. Rails also gives you three environments to use (development, testing, and production) that help the development process overall. Now the gist of what I'm saying here is that Rails streamlines the web development process, and is built on a Ruby framework. It takes older conventions from other frameworks and changes them in favor of an exprience that is much more intuitive and user friendly. Rails aims to be the whole web development package in one place. Now there are more nitty gritty things to be found regarding Rails, but this is all I have to say for now. Thanks for reading!

How was it to create an HTML page with a pair?

Creating the page with my pair was interesting, and definitelya new experience. It was nice to have someone to bonce ideas off of in the creative process. The idea of having someone there to tell you if you may be getting off track or pointing out syntax related information is quite valuable. Having a second opinion keeps you grounded, as well as focused.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I thought wireframing was helpful, knowing what my end result should look like. Coding with an end destination in mind really prevents my ideas from getting the better of me. If I know what I want already, I won't be wasting as much time deliberating over stylistic choices. To me, wireframing is to html as an outline is to an essay. You can totally get the job done without it, but the process is streamlined to a great extent.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided a more general approach is better. Honestly wireframing is meant to give you a skeleton for you to refer to in the future. You don't want to get too specific with your wireframe to the point where it has limited use. The more assignments your wireframe can assist you with, the better.

What new semantic elements did you learn about, (if any)?

I learned about wireframing formatting in general. I also got a nice refresher on basic html formatting, which is always good.
